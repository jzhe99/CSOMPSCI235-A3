# CS235-Assignment-2
Step1: find the location of the file by typing "cd desktop" and "CS235A2" 
Step2: typing "py -3 -m venv venv" 
Step3: typing "venv\Scripts\activate" 
Step4: typing "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
Step5: typing "flask run" to run the application 

Note: I also uploaded the file zip which would be better for markers to check my work because I'm not sure how to upload the whole file. Download the zip and run the application without missing files that I haven't uploaded. Thanks a lot!
